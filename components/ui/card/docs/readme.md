Cards are a flexible component used to display content and actions in a variety of contexts. They are generally restricted to a single topic and it should be easy for users to scan relevant and actionable information. Content, such as images and text, should be positioned within them in a manner that demonstrates their intended hierarchy.

## Import 

```
import { card } from 'kru-components';
```
